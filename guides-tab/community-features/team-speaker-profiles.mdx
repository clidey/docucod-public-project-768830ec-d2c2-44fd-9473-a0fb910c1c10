# Showcasing Teams and Speaker Profiles

## Overview
This guide empowers you to build, maintain, and promote dynamic team and speaker directories within your Aura-powered community web application. By following this workflow, you will enable your community to self-brand, allow easy public discovery through rich profiles, and leverage content sharing through public URLs.

Maintaining up-to-date and engaging team and speaker profiles helps build community identity and trust, enhances event visibility, and facilitates social promotion.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Manage multiple team roles such as Core Team, Organizing Team, and Volunteers with flexible visibility controls.
- Add and update speaker profiles, enriching them with bios, social links, company affiliations, and sessions.
- Enable public-facing directories and detailed profile views for easy discovery.
- Use public URLs to share profiles on social media, emails, or embedded links.

## Prerequisites
- Aura Main app configured and connected to your Firebase backend.
- Team and Speaker data properly structured and uploaded in Firestore under collections `team` and `Speakers`.
- Basic familiarity with Aura navigation and project configuration (see Setup and Configuration guides).

## 1. Managing Team Profiles

### Understanding Team Roles
Aura’s team functionality categorizes members into distinct roles:
- **Core Team:** The principal leadership or founding members.
- **Organizing Team:** Members actively managing or organizing events.
- **Volunteers:** Contributors supporting event and community activities.

Each member entry includes attributes like name, designation, social links, bio, profile image, role, and active status.

### Viewing Team Members
The Teams page automatically separates and lists Core Team and Organizing Team members with dedicated components:

- **Core Team Section:** Displays member cards aligned in a grid.
- **Organizing Team Section:** Presented as an interactive list for quick navigation.

If no members are found, a user-friendly "Team Not Found" message is displayed.

### Step-by-Step to Manage Teams
<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch Team Data">
Fetch team members from Firestore via the `getTeam()` service method. Filter data by member role and visibility status to organize members into respective sections.
</Step>
<Step title="Display Team Members">
Use the CoreTeam and OrganizingTeam components to visually render members. CoreTeam uses cards, OrganizingTeam uses a list layout with social links and actionable profile navigation.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to Member Details">
Enable clicking a team member to navigate to their detailed profile page using dynamic routes such as `/team/:id` where `id` is the member’s Firestore document ID.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tips
- Keep the `visible` attribute accurate to control public display.
- Confirm active status to highlight currently engaged members.
- Provide social media handles for richer profiles and networking.

## 2. Adding and Managing Speaker Profiles

### Speaker Directory
Speakers for events are maintained in a dedicated collection (`Speakers`) and reflect cross-event participation.

Speakers can have detailed profiles including:
- Name, designation, company, location (city, country)
- Bio and social media links
- Profile image
- List of sessions or events where they present

### Using the Speakers Page
A speaker lineup page lists all speakers related to a selected event, loading data dynamically and showing a loading indicator while fetching.

### Viewing Speaker Details
Clicking on a speaker opens a detailed profile page featuring:
- Speaker portrait and personal details
- Social media buttons
- Biography
- Session list with clickable links to event details

### Step-by-Step Instructions
<Steps>
<Step title="Load Speakers List">
Invoke the `getAllSpeakers()` method to retrieve all speaker profiles and match them with event speaker IDs.
</Step>
<Step title="Render Speaker Cards">
Use the `LayoutSpeaker` component to display speaker thumbnails and basic info in a responsive grid.
</Step>
<Step title="Access Speaker Details">
Implement navigation on speaker cards so users can view full profiles via routes like `/speakers/:id`.
</Step>
<Step title="Display Detailed Profile">
In the speaker detail view, call `getSpeaker(id)` and `getAllEvents()` to fetch biography and sessions. Handle not found cases gracefully with error messaging.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Practical Example: Speaker Profile Display
```vue
<v-avatar size="100">
  <v-img
    :src="speaker.image || fallbackImage"
    alt="Speaker Image"
  />
</v-avatar>
<p>{{ speaker.name }}</p>
<p>{{ speaker.designation }} at {{ speaker.company.name }}</p>
<div v-for="(link, platform) in speaker.socialLinks" :key="platform">
  <a :href="link" target="_blank">{{ platform }}</a>
</div>
```

## 3. Utilizing Public URLs for Social Promotion

Each team member and speaker has a dedicated public URL (e.g., `/team/:id` or `/speakers/:id`) that can be shared across social media, newsletters, or embedded links.

### Best Practices
- Use canonical URLs to improve SEO and shareability.
- Keep bios concise and visually engaging to encourage social sharing.
- Update social links regularly to ensure connectivity.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Team or Speaker Data Not Displaying
- Verify that Firestore collections `team` and `Speakers` contain documents with correct and complete data.
- Confirm `visible` flags are set to `true` for public profiles.
- Check network connectivity and Firestore permissions.

### "No Speaker Found" or "Team Not Found" Messages
- These appear if the data fetch returns empty or filtered results yield no visible entries.
- Validate the IDs referenced in event speaker or team arrays match Firestore document IDs.

### Profile Images Not Loading
- Ensure images are correctly referenced in Firestore. Use fallback placeholders if images are missing.
- Confirm image URLs are accessible publicly or properly stored in Firebase Storage with permissions.

<Warning>
Keep your Firestore security rules updated to allow read access as appropriate while protecting sensitive data.
</Warning>

## 5. Best Practices

- Regularly synchronize team and speaker data between Aura Admin and Aura Main to reflect changes promptly.
- Use consistent role naming conventions (`Core Team`, `Organizing Team`, `Volunteer`) to prevent filtering errors.
- Provide clear, engaging bios and social links to maximize profile appeal.
- Use the active/inactive status to avoid displaying outdated profiles.
