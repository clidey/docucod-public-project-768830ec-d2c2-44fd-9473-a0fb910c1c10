# SEO Optimization & App Performance

Ensure your Aura community site shines in search results and loads quickly for all users. This guide covers how to configure SEO-friendly routing, enable effective content indexing, and leverage Aura’s Progressive Web App (PWA) optimizations to deliver a fast, reliable user experience.

---

## 1. Understanding the Page’s Purpose

This page focuses on boosting your Aura site’s visibility on search engines and optimizing app responsiveness and load times. It guides you through practical steps to align your app’s routing, metadata, caching strategies, and PWA features for maximum performance and discoverability.

### What You Will Achieve
- Correct SEO-friendly URL routing and metadata setup
- Proper content indexing for improved search rankings
- Leveraging service workers for offline support and faster loading
- Using Aura’s PWA configuration for optimized user experience

### Prerequisites
- Aura site set up and running (see ‘Running Aura Locally & Quick Validation’ guide)
- Basic access to modify your project’s configuration files (e.g., `vue.config.js`, `public/index.html`)
- Firebase project integrated and PWA enabled

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes

### Skill Level
Intermediate

## 2. SEO-Friendly Routing and Metadata Configuration

Aura is built as a SPA (Single Page Application) with Vue.js, using client-side routing for navigation. To ensure SEO value:

### Step 1: Check and Configure HTML Metadata

1. Open the `public/index.html` file.
2. Confirm essential SEO meta tags are present:
  - `<title>` reflects your community’s name.
  - Open Graph (`og:`) meta tags define page previews for social media.
  - Keywords and description meta tags support search indexing.

Example snippet from `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no">
<meta name="keywords" content="GDG, Google, Google Developers Groups, Aura, Aura main, Aura admin, Admin, Vue, Vuetify">
<meta name="og:title" content="AURA - MAIN" />
<meta name="og:type" content="Community" />
<meta name="og:url" content="<%= BASE_URL %>" />
<meta name="og:site_name" content="GDG Website" />
<meta name="og:description" content="Google Developers Group is an initiative to concentrate efforts to learn and share Google products." />
```

3. Customize the `<title>`, keywords, and description to best represent your community.

<Tip>
Meta descriptions and keywords impact how search engines understand and display your site. Keep descriptions concise, unique, and relevant.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Use Clean URLs

Aura’s routing uses client-side router with history mode, configured via Firebase Hosting rewrites to serve `index.html` for all paths.

- Ensure your `firebase.json` contains the rewrite rule:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [{
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }],
    ...
  }
}
```

- This enables SEO-friendly URLs (e.g., `/events/123`) that are crawlable.

<Tip>
Avoid hash-based URLs (`/#/`) as they reduce SEO effectiveness.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Index Public Content Properly

Aura automatically loads public content such as events, team members, blogs, and partners dynamically. To facilitate this:

- Verify page content loads quickly and fully render on the client.
- Use SSR or prerendering if advanced SEO is needed (outside Aura’s default scope).

## 3. Leveraging Aura’s PWA & Caching Optimizations

Aura is configured as a Progressive Web App to improve loading speed and offline capability by caching assets and data.

### Step 1: Understand Service Worker Registration

The service worker is registered in `src/registerServiceWorker.js`. It enables offline content caching and automatic updates.

```js
import { register } from 'register-service-worker'

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  register(`${process.env.BASE_URL}service-worker.js`, {
    ready () {
      console.log('App is being served from cache by a service worker.')
    },
    registered (registration) {
      console.log('Service worker has been registered.')
      setInterval(() => { registration.update(); }, 3600000); // hourly
    },
    cached () { console.log('Content cached offline.') },
    updatefound () { console.log('New content downloading.') },
    updated (registration) { /* Notify user to refresh to get updates */ },
    offline () { console.log('No internet connection detected.') },
    error (error) { console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error) }
  })
}
```

### Step 2: Configure `vue.config.js` for PWA

Key configuration in `vue.config.js` enables PWA features using Workbox with InjectManifest:

```js
module.exports = {
  productionSourceMap: false,
  pwa: {
    name: 'Aura Main',
    workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',
    themeColor: '#4A90E2',
    msTileColor: '#4A90E2',
    appleMobileWebAppCapable: 'yes',
    appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle: 'black',
    manifestOptions: { background_color: '#ffffff' },
    workboxOptions: {
      swSrc: './src/sw.js',
      swDest: 'service-worker.js',
    },
  }
}
```

- This setup ensures:
  - Custom service worker allows advanced caching strategies.
  - PWA manifest supports installability and theming.

<Tip>
Customize the service worker file `src/sw.js` carefully to manage caching rules for dynamic content if needed.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Manage Updates and User Experience

Aura’s main app listens for service worker update events and surfaces a refresh prompt to users:

- When a new version is available, a snackbar with a "Refresh" button appears.
- Clicking refresh reloads the app, updating to the latest version.

This process ensures users always load fresh content without confusion or stale data.

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep metadata current:** Update titles, descriptions, and keywords whenever your community details change.
- **Monitor caching:** Use Chrome DevTools Application tab to inspect service worker caches.
- **Test offline mode:** Disable network and verify your site remains accessible with cached content.
- **Use meaningful URLs:** Keep URLs descriptive and concise for better SEO and user understanding.
- **Leverage Lighthouse audits:** Run [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to validate SEO and performance.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Search engines do not index dynamic content

- **Cause:** SPA content is client-rendered and may not be fully crawlable.
- **Solution:** Use prerendering or server-side rendering (SSR) for critical pages if SEO ranking is poor.

### Issue: Updates to the app do not reflect immediately

- **Cause:** Service worker caching old assets.
- **Solution:** Encourage users to refresh when prompted. For dev, unregister existing SW from browser settings.

### Issue: Offline mode loads outdated or broken pages

- **Cause:** Service worker caching stale content or improper caching strategy.
- **Solution:** Review `src/sw.js` caching rules and update strategies, clear caches for testing.

### Issue: Slow app loading times

- **Cause:** Large JavaScript bundles or excessive third-party scripts.
- **Solution:** Use code splitting, remove unused dependencies, optimize assets, and enable gzip compression on hosting.

<Warning>
Avoid disabling service workers in production as it will impact offline capabilities and performance benefits.
</Warning>
