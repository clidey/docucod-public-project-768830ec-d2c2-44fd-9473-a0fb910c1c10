## 4. Step-by-Step: Managing and Showcasing Team & Speaker Profiles

### Step 1: Prepare Profiles for Public Display
Ensure your team members and speakers have the required details registered in the Aura Admin interface (names, photos, bios, social links, company info).

### Step 2: Confirm Visibility Settings
Profiles should be marked as **visible** in Aura to appear in public listings and searches.

### Step 3: Access Public Directory
Navigate to the `/speakers` or `/team` paths on your Aura site to view the public directory pages where members are listed.

### Step 4: Explore Individual Profiles
- Click on a profile card to visit the detailed page.
- Check their biography section, social media icons, and list of sessions or team roles.

### Step 5: Share Public URLs
Copy the profile URL from the browser address bar to share externally, invite networking, or promote event speakers.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep Bios and Social Links Updated**: Regular updates keep profiles fresh and engaging.
- **Use Clear, Professional Photos**: Visual identity is key for first impressions.
- **Enable Visibility Only When Ready**: Hidden profiles help control content staging.
- **Link Speakers to Sessions**: Connect speakers to event sessions so visitors can explore their contributions.
- **Utilize Public URLs in Marketing**: Amplify reach by sharing these links in newsletters and social media.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Profiles Not Showing Up in Directory
- Verify the **visible** attribute is enabled for the profile.
- Check network issues or API response errors when fetching speaker data.

### Missing Profile Images
- Confirm image URLs are correctly configured.
- Ensure images are uploaded to the CDN or hosting service.

### Incorrect or Missing Social Links
- Use the Aura Admin panel to edit and verify valid social URLs.

### Speaker Sessions Not Displayed
- Confirm speakers are correctly assigned to event sessions in the backend.

### Handling "Profile Not Found" Errors
- This occurs if the profile ID does not exist; verify the URL and existence of the speaker or team member.

## 7. Example Scenario: Viewing a Speaker Profile

Imagine a conference attendee wants to learn more about 'Jane Doe', a speaker at your community event:

1. The attendee visits the `/speakers` page and locates Jane’s profile card featuring her photo and company.
2. They click Jane’s card, opening her detailed profile.
3. They see her bio, social media icons, and list of sessions she will present.
4. The attendee shares Jane’s public URL on Twitter to invite others to her sessions.

This workflow highlights Aura’s ease of self-branding and community engagement.
