## 1. Getting Started with Events in Aura

### What You Will Achieve
- Publish new events and update existing ones with ease.

- Provide organized directories of past events for reference and discovery.
- Share events publicly with custom event pages and embedded links.

### Prerequisites
- Access to the Aura Admin panel with permissions to manage events.
- Proper Firebase configuration connected to your Aura instance.
- A Meetup API key configured, if integrating with Meetup events (optional).

### Time Estimate
- Initial event setup and publishing: 10-20 minutes.
- Ongoing updates and content promotion: 5-10 minutes per event.

### Difficulty Level
- Beginner to Intermediate. The UI and workflows are designed for straightforward use without coding.

## 2. Publishing Events Workflow

### 2.1 Overview of Event Types
Aura supports different event sourcing methods:
- **Meetup Events:** Automatically fetched and displayed using a Meetup group API key.
- **Custom Events:** Fully controlled through Aura, allowing you to create and manage event details manually.
- **Feature Events:** Specially highlighted events curated via Firebase that can be showcased prominently.

### 2.2 Creating and Managing Custom Events
1. **Access the Event Management Section:**
   - Navigate to the Events page.
   - Use the 'Create New Event' option or select an existing event to update.
2. **Fill in Event Details:**
   - Provide clear names, dates, venues, descriptions, and important links.
   - Upload relevant images or featured graphics to enhance your event page.
3. **Set Visibility:**
   - Toggle visibility status to control if the event appears publicly.
4. **Save and Publish:**
   - Submit your event data to Firebase.
   - Confirm the event page is live under your events directory.

### 2.3 Publishing Meetup Events
- If you have a Meetup group linked, Aura automatically fetches your upcoming and past Meetup events via the Meetup API.
- To enable this, ensure your Meetup API key is configured in the system settings.
- The system will display upcoming Meetup events dynamically on the Events page with details and public links.

### 2.4 Highlighting Featured Events
- Use the 'Feature Events' feature to spotlight select events.
- Featured events are fetched from a curated list in Firebase, which you can update to control which events are promoted.

## 3. Navigating Event Pages and Content

### 3.1 Upcoming Events Display
- Aura shows upcoming events prominently with cards displaying key details like event name, date, and description.
- Loading indicators and error alerts ensure transparency in data retrieval.
- Example: The `UpcomingEvents` component fetches data and displays each event as a card.

### 3.2 Past Events and Custom Past Events
- Past events are listed in reverse chronological order.
- Search functionality lets attendees find events by name or location.
- Past events data comes either from Meetup or your custom database depending on configuration.

### 3.3 Custom Event Pages
- Each event has a dedicated page showing detailed information.
- Features include event schedules, speaker lists, and share buttons.
- The share feature supports modern browser sharing APIs and graceful fallbacks.

## 5. Practical Examples

### Example: Fetching Upcoming Meetup Events
```javascript
service.getAllUpcomingMeetupsEvents(meetupApiKey).then(res => {
  if (res.success && res.data.length > 0) {
    // Render events on page
  } else {
    // Show 'No Upcoming Events' message
  }
}).catch(error => {
  // Display error alert
});
```

### Example: Displaying Past Custom Events with Search
- Use the integrated search field to filter past events by name.
- Pagination allows viewing events five at a time.

### Practical Tips
- Always verify the Meetup API key’s validity to avoid fetching errors.
- Keep event descriptions concise but informative.
- Use share buttons to maximize event reach.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Event Not Showing:** Check if the event’s visibility flag is enabled.
- **Meetup Data Fails to Load:** Confirm API key is correct and the Meetup service is available.
- **Share Button Not Working:** Some browsers may not support the native share API; copy the URL manually as fallback.

### Best Practices
- Regularly update featured event lists to keep content fresh.
- Use clear, community-friendly language in event descriptions.
- Test event pages on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Performance Considerations
- Limit the number of events displayed per page to improve load speeds.
- Optimize images used on event pages to reduce bandwidth.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use Custom Events if Meetup integration is not desired or is unavailable.
- Highlight events using Feature Events to draw user attention to important sessions.
