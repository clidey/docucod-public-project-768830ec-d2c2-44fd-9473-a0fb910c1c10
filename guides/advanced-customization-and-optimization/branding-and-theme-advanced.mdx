## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Update Theme Colors
Aura uses Vuetify’s theming system allowing you to adjust colors globally.

1. Open the `src/plugins/vuetify.js` file in your Aura source code.
2. Locate the `theme` object defining `light` and `dark` color palettes.
3. Modify the `primary`, `secondary`, and `accent` colors to your brand’s color codes.

Example:
```javascript
import colors from 'vuetify/lib/util/colors'

export default new Vuetify({
  theme: {
    themes: {
      light: {
        primary: colors.deepPurple.accent4,  // change from colors.blue
        secondary: colors.amber.darken2,     // your secondary color
        accent: colors.blueGrey.darken3       
      },
      dark: {
        primary: colors.deepPurple.accent4
      }
    },
  },
});
```

4. Save the file and rebuild your project (`npm run build` or `npm run serve` for local).

**Success Criteria:** The app’s primary UI elements reflect your new color scheme in both light and dark modes.

### Step 2: Change the Community Logo
Your logo appears primarily in the Toolbar component and other navigation headers.

1. Prepare a logo image optimized for web (SVG, PNG with transparent background recommended).
2. Upload your logo to your hosting or include it in the Aura Admin configuration under `generalConfig.toolbarImage`.
3. In Aura Main, the logo path is referenced dynamically. To update it manually:
    - Access your configuration store or the database where `generalConfig.toolbarImage` is set.
    - Update the URL to point to your new logo.

If using Aura Admin:
- Navigate to the Branding section.
- Upload or set the new logo URL for the Toolbar image.

4. Refresh the Aura app to see the updated logo.

**Success Criteria:** The Toolbar and header display your updated logo clearly.

<Tip>
Make sure your logo dimensions align well with the toolbar space to avoid layout issues. A width around 25px is used in Aura for the toolbar logo.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Customize Layout and Visibility
Aura offers predefined components such as Toolbar, Drawer, Bottom Navigation, and Footer, each playing a role in your site’s UI.

1. Review the Toolbar links from the `src/store/index.js` under `state.items`. These determine what navigation tabs are visible.

2. To show or hide links in the Toolbar:
   - Adjust the `meta.showToolbar` flag for each item.

Example:
```js
{ text: 'Partners', to: '/partners', icon: 'mdi-currency-usd', meta: { showToolbar: false, showBottomNav: false } }
```
Setting `showToolbar` to false hides that item in the top navigation.

3. Layout Component Order:
   - Aura automatically hides elements like Bottom Navigation or Drawer based on route context (e.g., event pages).
   - You can further modify visibility logic in components like `src/App.vue` where conditions govern rendering.

4. To fine-tune look and spacing, modify CSS classes in your component files, respecting Vuetify’s theming and responsiveness.

**Success Criteria:** The navigation and page layout reflect your preferred content visibility and arrangement.

### Step 4: Protect Accessibility and Usability
Brand customization must not degrade accessibility or user experience.

- Maintain sufficient contrast when choosing theme colors. Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- Use recognizable icons and labels in navigation for all users.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and focus states remain visible.
- Validate responsive behavior across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

**Best Practice:** Test any branding changes using accessibility evaluation tools and real user feedback.

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example Configuration Snippet for Vuetify Theme
```javascript
import colors from 'vuetify/lib/util/colors'

export default new Vuetify({
  theme: {
    themes: {
      light: {
        primary: '#1a237e', // your brand primary color
        secondary: '#ff6f00',
        accent: '#00bcd4',
        error: '#f44336'
      },
      dark: {
        primary: '#1a237e'
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### Example JSON Fragment for Toolbar Logo URL
```json
{
  "generalConfig": {
    "toolbarImage": "https://yourcdn.com/images/logo.svg",
    "name": "Your Community",
    "shortName": "YC"
  }
}
```

### Adjusting Navigation Links
```js
state.items = [
  ...
  { text: 'Blogs', to: '/blogs', meta: { showToolbar: true, showBottomNav: false } },
  { text: 'Partners', to: '/partners', meta: { showToolbar: false, showBottomNav: false } },
  ...
]
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Theme Colors Not Updating After Changes">
- **Cause:** Browser cache or service worker cache may serve old styles.
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache, reload the page with Ctrl+Shift+R, or unregister the service worker via dev tools.
- Also, ensure you rebuilt and redeployed the app after changes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Logo Not Displaying">
- **Cause:** Incorrect image URL or missing permissions.
- **Solution:** Verify the logo URL is correct and accessible publicly.
- Confirm the configuration is correctly loaded — check Vuex state `config.generalConfig.toolbarImage`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Navigation Items Not Showing or Hidden">
- **Cause:** `showToolbar` flag set incorrectly.
- **Solution:** Confirm these flags in your config store match your intended visibility.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use Vuetify's theme dark and light mode toggling to preview your colors and logos on both modes before finalizing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Maintain logo image size and file format consistent with Aura defaults to avoid distortion.
</Tip>
