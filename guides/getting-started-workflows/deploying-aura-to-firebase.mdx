# Deploying Aura to Firebase: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to the definitive guide for deploying Aura, the powerful tech community web app, onto Firebase Hosting. This walkthrough will empower you to prepare your environment, connect Aura to your Firebase project, and successfully launch your community portal online for the first time. Ideal if you're new to either Firebase or Aura, this guide will carefully lead you through every step with practical examples and troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth deployment.

---

## 1. Deployment Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
By following this guide, you will deploy your locally developed Aura instance to Firebase Hosting, making your community web app publicly accessible with offline support, domain hosting, and PWA capabilities.

### Prerequisites
- A Firebase project set up in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with Hosting enabled.
- The Aura project cloned and configured locally with your Firebase details updated in the project.
- Node.js and npm installed (Node.js v8.9.4 to v12.13.0 recommended).
- Firebase CLI installed globally (`npm install -g firebase-tools`).
- Your Aura web app fully tested and built for production locally.

### Expected Outcome
- An optimized, production-ready Aura build deployed on Firebase Hosting.
- Offline-first capabilities enabled through service workers.
- Your project's Firebase Hosting site successfully live with a public URL.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-60 minutes, including setup and deployment.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate (Detailed step-by-step guidance provided).

## 2. Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Confirm Firebase Project and Configuration

1. Log in to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Select or create your Firebase project. This project must be the same used in your Aura Admin backend.
3. Under the "Project Settings" > "General" tab, scroll down to your web app's Firebase SDK snippet.
4. Copy the configuration object containing apiKey, authDomain, databaseURL, etc.
5. Update the file `src/config/firebase.js` in your Aura codebase with this configuration.

_Example snippet from `firebase.js` updated with your project settings:_
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-project.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdefg"
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

> Ensure this matches your Firebase Console exactly for authentication and Firestore connection to work.

---

### Step 2: Install Firebase CLI and Authenticate

From your project root directory:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

- The `firebase login` command will open a browser window for authentication.
- Follow prompts to allow CLI access to your Firebase projects.

---

### Step 3: Initialize and Configure Firebase Hosting in the Project

If you have not yet created `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` files manually, run:

```bash
firebase init
```

- Select **Hosting** feature.
- Choose your existing Firebase project.
- Set the public directory to `dist` (the folder generated by your production build).
- Configure as a single-page app? Choose **Yes** to enable routing fallback.

Alternatively, verify your `firebase.json` matches the following, especially the `site` key matching your Firebase Hosting Site ID:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "myaurapp",
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [{
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }],
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  }
}
```

> Replace "myaurapp" with your Firebase Hosting site ID derived from your Hosting dashboard URL prefix.

---

### Step 4: Build Production Version of Aura

Run Aura’s build command to generate an optimized production release:

```bash
npm run build
```

- This creates the `dist` directory containing the ready-to-deploy files.
- Confirm the build completes without errors and the `dist` folder exists.

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

Deploy your project by running:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

- The CLI will upload the contents of the `dist` directory to Firebase Hosting.
- On success, the CLI outputs the publicly accessible URL (e.g., `https://myaurapp.web.app`).

---

### Step 6: Verify Your Deployment

1. Open the URL provided by the Firebase CLI (e.g., `https://myaurapp.web.app`).
2. Navigate through the Aura app to confirm everything loads correctly.
3. Test offline support by disconnecting your internet and refreshing — the app should load cached content.

If you see errors or blank pages:
- Confirm your Firebase config matches the project.
- Check browser console for network or service worker issues.
- Verify you deployed the correct build folder.

---

## 3. Service Worker and Offline Support

Aura uses a service worker powered by Workbox configured in `vue.config.js` and registered via `src/registerServiceWorker.js` to enable offline use:

- Ensure your production build contains the service worker file `service-worker.js` served from the root.
- The service worker caches app shell and assets for offline access.
- The app listens for updates and prompts you to refresh when new content is available.

Troubleshooting service worker:
- If offline mode fails, clear browser cache and unregister previous service workers.
- Check console logs related to service worker status.

## 4. Common Troubleshooting and Tips

<Tip>
Always confirm your Firebase project's API keys and identifiers in `src/config/firebase.js` are accurate and correspond to the right Firebase project.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using mismatched Firebase projects between Aura Admin and Aura Main leads to data inaccessibility and broken features.
</Warning>

<Info>
After deploying, if your app shows a loading screen or "Site not configured" message, clear browser cache, ensure successful build, and confirm proper Firebase Hosting configuration.
</Info>

<Tip>
Use `firebase deploy --only hosting` if you made changes only to your front-end build and need to redeploy without affecting other Firebase services.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Watch for case sensitivity in folder names and Firebase site keys (“myaurapp” vs “MyAurApp”).
</Warning>
