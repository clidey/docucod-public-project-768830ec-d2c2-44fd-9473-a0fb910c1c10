# Essential Configuration & Theme Setup

Welcome to the essential guide for setting up Aura’s configuration files and theme options. This walkthrough will help you connect your Aura web app to Aura Admin, configure critical system files, and enable core features such as dark/light themes and Progressive Web App (PWA) offline mode. By the end, your tech community’s branding and settings will be fully prepared for launch.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- **Establish connection** between Aura Main and Aura Admin to load your community’s configuration securely.
- **Configure key files** such as general settings, keys and security, and footer links.
- **Enable and customize theme options**, including dark and light modes.
- **Activate offline support** by setting up the PWA mode correctly.

### Prerequisites
- Completed cloning and local setup of both Aura Main and Aura Admin repositories.
- Firebase project configured for both Aura codebases.
- Firebase credentials and configuration files ready.
- Basic familiarity with Vue.js and Vuetify (optional but helpful).

### Expected Outcome
- Aura app properly reads all essential configuration files on launch.
- Dark/light theme toggling works seamlessly according to user preference.
- Offline PWA features enabled, providing resilience for users with unstable internet.
- Your community’s branding, event links, and social settings are visible and functional.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30 to 45 minutes depending on familiarity with basic web app setup.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Configuration File Structure
Aura loads three main configurations from Aura Admin:

- `generalConfig` — Contains community branding details, descriptions, social links, meetup URLs.
- `keysandsecurity` — Holds API keys like Meetup API tokens and security settings.
- `footerConfig` — Defines footer links and related information.

These configurations populate the Vuex store and drive the content displayed throughout the app.

**How to check:** Confirm your Aura Admin project has these configurations saved and published.

### Step 2: Connect Aura Main to Aura Admin Config
Aura Main fetches configuration data using an HTTP service call (`appservices.js`). This occurs within the main `App.vue` component:

1. App.vue calls `getAllConfig()` from the service.
2. It stores the retrieved configs in Vuex store states.
3. These states inject configuration data for all components.

**Action:** Make sure the URLs and Firebase configs in Aura Main correctly point to your Firebase project and Aura Admin backend.

**Result:** Aura app will load without `noData` errors and populate UI content dynamically.

### Step 3: Enable Dark/Light Theme Support
Aura uses Vuetify for UI theming, set up in `src/plugins/vuetify.js`. The theme toggle respects a saved user preference stored in local storage.

**How to enable and verify:**
- On app load (in `App.vue` `beforeCreate` hook), the code reads:
  ```js
  localStorage.getItem("darkMode") == "true"
    ? (this.$vuetify.theme.dark = true)
    : (this.$vuetify.theme.dark = false);
  ```
- Users can toggle dark mode, and the preference persists across sessions.
- UI containers use dynamic coloring based on theme state (see Home.vue’s `darkModeContainer` and `lightModeContainer`).

**Tip:** Customize themes in `vuetify.js` to align colors with your brand.

### Step 4: Activate Offline PWA Mode
Aura leverages the Vue CLI PWA plugin with Workbox to enable offline mode.

**Key file:** `vue.config.js`
- Defines manifest options like app name, theme color, and icons.
- Points to a custom service worker source file (`./src/sw.js`).

**How to confirm PWA setup:**
- Ensure `registerServiceWorker.js` is included (it is imported in `src/main.js`).
- The service worker handles caching and triggers a popup snackbar upon updates.

**User experience:**
- When a new version of the app is available, a refresh snackbar prompts the user to reload.
- The app content remains accessible offline, enhancing stability.

### Step 5: Customize General Branding and Settings
Most visible configurations come from the `generalConfig` data:

- Community `name`, `shortName`, and descriptions appear in multiple components, such as the About page and Home.
- Social and meetup links enable event integration.
- Color theming and icons can be further customized via this config.

**Action:** Use Aura Admin Admin interface to update these values.

### Step 6: Verify Footer and Security Keys
Check the `footerConfig` in Vuex to confirm footer navigation links.
Confirm `keysandsecurity` contains necessary values such as your Meetup API key.

## 3. Examples & Configuration Snippets

### Vuex Configurations Set by App.vue
```js
mutations: {
  setGeneralConfig: (state, payload) => (state.config.generalConfig = payload),
  setKeysAndSecutityConfig: (state, payload) => (state.config.keysandsecurity = payload),
  setFooterConfig: (state, payload) => (state.config.footerConfig = payload),
},
```

### Vuetify Theme Configuration (`vuetify.js`)
```js
export default new Vuetify({
  theme: {
    themes: {
      light: {
        primary: colors.blue,
        secondary: colors.grey.darken1,
        accent: colors.shades.black,
        error: colors.red.accent3
      },
      dark: {
        primary: colors.blue,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### PWA Plugin Configuration (`vue.config.js` snippet)
```js
pwa: {
  name: 'Aura Main',
  workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',
  themeColor: '#4A90E2',
  msTileColor: '#4A90E2',
  appleMobileWebAppCapable: 'yes',
  appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle: 'black',
  manifestOptions: {background_color: "#ffffff"},
  workboxOptions: {swSrc: './src/sw.js', swDest: 'service-worker.js'},
},
```

### Sample Getting Configuration in `App.vue`
```js
methods: {
  getData() {
    this.isLoading = true;
    service.getAllConfig().then(res => {
      if (res.success) {
        res.data.forEach(ele => {
          if (ele.name == "footer") this.setFooterConfig(ele.data.links);
          else if (ele.name == "general") this.setGeneralConfig(ele.data);
          else if (ele.name == "keysandsecurity") this.setKeysAndSecutityConfig(ele.data);
        });
        this.noData = false;
      } else {
        this.noData = true;
      }
      this.isLoading = false;
    });
  }
}
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **`noData` Screen Displays**: 
  - This happens if configuration fetch fails during `App.vue` lifecycle.
  - Double-check Aura Admin connection, Firebase configurations, and API tokens.
- **Theme Not Switching Properly**:
  - Verify that the `darkMode` localStorage key persists and that your `vuetify.js` theme matches.
- **Service Worker Not Updating**:
  - Ensure `sw.js` is present and the Workbox `InjectManifest` plugin properly configured.
  - Use browser devtools to inspect service worker registration and cache.

### Best Practices
- Always keep your Aura Admin and Aura Main connected to the same Firebase project.
- Regularly update your community branding and keys in Aura Admin to reflect in Aura Main.
- Customize Vuetify themes to maintain consistent community identity.
- Test offline features by simulating network disconnection.

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize changes to service worker files to reduce update delays.
- Optimize configuration data size—only store necessary fields.

### Alternative Approaches
- For advanced theme customization, consider overriding Vuetify sass variables or extending theme definitions.
- Offline support can be enhanced with custom caching strategies in `sw.js`.
