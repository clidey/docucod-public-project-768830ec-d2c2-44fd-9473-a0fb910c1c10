# Troubleshooting Setup & Common Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide for Aura's setup and initial launch. This page empowers you to quickly identify and resolve frequent installation and first-run problems — whether you're facing environment mismatches, configuration errors, or unexpected app behavior — without spending excessive time navigating support channels.

---

## 1. Common Installation & Environment Issues

### 1.1 Firebase Configuration Mismatches

- **Symptom:** App fails to load or shows "no data" with messages like _"Site is not Configured"_ on launch.
- **Cause:** Your Firebase project details (API keys, project ID, auth domain, etc.) in `src/config/firebase.js` do not match the project set up on Firebase Console or are incomplete.

**Action Steps:**
1. Verify you have copied the Firebase config exactly from your Firebase Console:
   - Check apiKey, authDomain, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, and appId.
2. Confirm your Firebase project and Aura Admin use the same Firebase configuration for syncing data.
3. Ensure Firestore database rules allow the app to read required collections.

<Note>
Always keep the Firebase config synchronized between Aura and Aura Admin repositories to avoid data access failures.
</Note>

### 1.2 Node.js and Dependency Installation Issues

- **Symptom:** Errors during `npm install` or `npm run serve` such as module not found, or incompatible versions.
- **Cause:** Using unsupported Node.js versions or outdated package manager.

**Action Steps:**
1. Aura requires Node.js (version 14 or later recommended).
2. Check your Node and npm versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

3. If incompatible, install the recommended Node.js version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
4. Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again.

### 1.3 Service Worker & PWA Errors

- **Symptom:** App does not refresh new updates or shows offline issues unexpectedly.
- **Cause:** Problems with service worker registration or caching strategy.

**Action Steps:**
1. Check browser console logs for service worker errors.
2. Try clearing cache and unregistering service workers manually:

```
In Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers, unregister existing workers.
```

3. Restart your dev server and reload the app.
4. See the [Optimizing PWA & Offline Support](../../guides/advanced-customization-and-optimization/optimizing-pwa-and-offline-support) guide for advanced troubleshooting.

## 2. First-Run Configuration Errors

### 2.1 Missing or Empty Configuration Data

- **Symptom:** App shows loading spinner indefinitely or "No Data" messages after launch.
- **Cause:** The app’s Vuex store is unable to fetch general, security key, or footer configuration from Firestore.

**Action Steps:**
1. Open Firestore and check the `config` collection:
   - Documents like `general`, `footer`, and `keysandsecurity` should exist and have non-empty data.
2. Confirm that `src/services/appservices.js` can fetch this data without errors.
3. Inspect network tab during app load to verify Firebase reads succeed.
4. If data is missing, apply initial configuration settings or re-import them from Aura Admin.

<Warning>
Without proper config data, Aura cannot correctly populate theme, keys, or footer, causing UI failure.
</Warning>

### 2.2 Vuex Store Not Updating or Missing Data

- **Symptom:** UI components like events, team, or speakers remain blank.
- **Cause:** Either config data is missing or Vuex mutations are not committed correctly in `src/App.vue`.

**Action Steps:**
1. Verify in `src/App.vue` that `getData()` successfully retrieves data and commits mutations.
2. Confirm Firestore permissions and network connectivity.
3. Review console logs for errors or warnings during data fetch.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Common UI & Data Fetching Issues

### 3.1 Events or Teams Not Displaying

- **Symptom:** Event lists or team directories are empty or show error messages.

**Action Steps:**
1. Ensure Firestore collections `events` and `team` contain documents.
2. Confirm visibility flags (e.g., `visible` set to `true`) for events.
3. In components like `src/components/events/PastEvents.vue` and `src/components/events/UpcomingEvents.vue`, check if API calls succeed:

```js
service.getAllEvents()
service.getAllMeetupPastEvents()
```

4. Check for any error snackbars or messages that indicate fetch failures.

### 3.2 API Errors and Network Failures

- **Symptom:** Snackbars show messages like _"Issue found with <error>"_.

**Action Steps:**
1. Verify your internet connectivity.
2. Confirm your Firebase project is active and properly configured.
3. For calls to external APIs (e.g., Meetup API proxied via CORS), ensure the proxy service (like cors-anywhere) is operational or replace it with your own proxy.
4. Check browser console for detailed error traces.

## 4. Step-By-Step Quick Troubleshooting Flow

Follow this checklist to efficiently identify setup problems:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Firebase Configuration">
Open `src/config/firebase.js` and verify your Firebase keys are correct and correspond to your Firebase Console.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Firestore Data">
Log into your Firebase Console Firestore and ensure key collections and documents exist (`config/general`, `team`, `events`).
</Step>
<Step title="Run App with Logs">
Start the app with `npm run serve` and monitor terminal and browser console for warnings or errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Clear Cache & Service Workers">
Clear browser cache and unregister old service workers to avoid stale data or installation conflicts.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Network Connections">
Ensure you have active internet access, and there are no firewall rules blocking Firebase or external APIs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips & Best Practices

- **Match Config Across Repositories:** Aura Main and Aura Admin must share the same Firebase project configuration to synchronize data and avoid runtime fetch issues.
- **Test with Minimal Data:** Begin with a handful of test events and team members to isolate data fetch problems.
- **Monitor Logs:** Browser console and terminal logs are your first sources of truth. Investigate warnings or stack traces promptly.
- **Validate Firestore Rules:** Incorrect security rules can silently block data reads.
- **Update Dependencies:** Regularly update npm packages and dependencies to keep compatibility with Firebase SDKs.

<Tip>
Using the development server logs and browser DevTools network inspector will drastically reduce your troubleshooting time.
