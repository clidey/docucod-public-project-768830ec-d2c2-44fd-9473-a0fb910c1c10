# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve some of the most frequent problems encountered during Aura setup and usage. Whether it's Firebase credential misconfiguration, npm version incompatibilities, or CLI command failures, this guide provides actionable steps to remedy these issues and get your environment running smoothly.

---

## 1. Diagnosing Setup Errors

To successfully run Aura, several components need to be correctly set up, including Firebase configuration, npm dependencies, and the Aura CLI. Problems during these initial steps can cause failure in running the app locally or deploying it.

This section helps you identify the most likely causes behind common setbacks and guides you through resolving them.

### Common Setup Error Categories
- **Firebase Credentials Misconfiguration**
- **npm Version Mismatch or Dependency Conflicts**
- **Failed CLI Commands or Build Steps**


---

## 2. Troubleshooting Firebase Credentials Issues

Aura requires Firebase credentials to be correctly set up for authentication, database access, and hosting.

### Symptoms
- Errors related to Firebase during development or deployment
- Authentication failures
- Firestore collection access errors
- App content not loading correctly

### Actionable Remedies
1. **Verify Firebase Project**
   - Confirm that you are using the *same* Firebase project for both the Aura Main and Aura Admin repositories.
   - Check your Firebase project ID matches in the configuration files.
   
2. **Check Firebase Configuration File**
   - Confirm your `firebaseConfig` object in the project points to the right API keys, Auth domain, Database URL, and other credentials.
   - Ensure the config file is updated after cloning or forking the repo.

3. **Inspect Firestore Rules and Collections**
   - Make sure Firestore rules allow read/write access as expected during development.
   - Review collections such as `team`, `events`, `Speakers`, and `config` exist and contain the necessary data.

4. **Reauthenticate Firebase CLI**
   Run:
   ```bash
   firebase logout
   firebase login
   ```
   to refresh CLI credentials.

5. **Test Firestore Access Manually**
   - Use Firebase console to verify you can read/write to collections.

<Tip>
Firebase misconfiguration is the most frequent source of errors. Always double-check your Firebase credentials and project association first before proceeding to complex fixes.
</Tip>

## 3. Resolving npm and Dependency Issues

Aura depends on specific npm versions and packages to function correctly. Misalignment between project dependencies and your environment can cause build errors or failed npm install.

### Symptoms
- `npm install` fails with errors
- Build compilation errors
- Unexpected runtime errors due to missing or incompatible packages

### Recommended Steps

1. **Check Your Node.js and npm Versions**

Run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Compare with Aura’s required versions listed in the `package.json` or project documentation. Upgrade or downgrade accordingly.

2. **Clean npm Cache and Reinstall Dependencies**

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

3. **Update npm to Latest Stable Version**

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

4. **Use `npm ci` for Consistent Install (if using lockfile)**

If a `package-lock.json` is present, prefer:

```bash
npm ci
```

5. **Check for Peer Dependency Warnings and Fix**

Review warnings during npm install and address peer dependency conflicts by adjusting package versions or running npm audit/fix.

<Tip>
Use Node Version Manager ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) to easily switch Node.js versions without system-wide impact.
</Tip>

## 4. Handling Failed CLI Commands and Build Errors

CLI commands for running, building, or deploying Aura might fail due to misconfiguration or missing steps.

### Common Failures
- `npm run serve` or `npm run dev` fails to start the local dev server
- `npm run build` throws errors or incomplete builds
- Firebase CLI deployment commands fail

### Step-by-Step Remedies

1. **Validate Environment Variables and Firebase Setup**

- Confirm `.env` or config files are properly set.
- Refer to the Firebase setup and environment configuration documentation for precise values.

2. **Run Development Server**

Try:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Look for errors that can signal missing packages or config issues.

3. **Build for Production**

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Check for errors and warnings; fix any reported missing modules or permissions.

4. **Firebase Deploy**

Use:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Make sure you are logged into Firebase CLI:

```bash
firebase login
```

and that your project alias is correctly set:

```bash
firebase use <your_project_id>
```

5. **Review Logs for Clues**

CLI output usually states the cause clearly; hone in on the specific error messages for troubleshooting.

- **Official Support Channels:** Check Aura’s GitHub issues at [https://github.com/gdg-x/aura/issues](https://github.com/gdg-x/aura/issues)

- **Community Forums:** Join community chats or forums where Aura developers discuss problems
