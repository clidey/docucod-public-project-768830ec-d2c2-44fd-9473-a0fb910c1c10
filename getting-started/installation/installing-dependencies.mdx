# Installing Dependencies

This guide walks you through setting up the essential dependencies for Aura by installing Node.js, Vue CLI, and running `npm install` to prepare your development environment. Properly managing and verifying installed packages ensures smooth operation and avoids common pitfalls during setup.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, confirm the following prerequisites are met:

- **Node.js Installed:** Aura requires Node.js to run JavaScript outside the browser. Use Node.js version 14.x or later.
- **Vue CLI Installed:** Vue CLI facilitates project scaffolding and management.
- **Internet Access:** Needed to download packages from npm registry.

If you have not installed Node.js or Vue CLI, follow these steps:

### Install Node.js

1. Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the LTS version suitable for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Expected output:

```
v14.x.x (or higher)
6.x.x (or higher)
```

### Install Vue CLI

1. After installing Node.js, install Vue CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

2. Verify installation:

```bash
vue --version
```

Expected output is the Vue CLI version number (e.g., 4.x.x or higher).

<Check>
Ensure Node.js and Vue CLI versions meet the minimum requirements before continuing.
</Check>

## 2. Running npm install to Install Project Dependencies

After cloning or obtaining the Aura source code (see the "[Getting the Code](./getting-started/installation/getting-the-code)" guide), you need to install its dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory** where the Aura source code resides:

```bash
cd path/to/aura
```

3. **Run npm install:**

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to install exact versions of required packages.

4. **Wait for the installation to complete.** A successful install results in a `node_modules` folder with all packages.

5. **Verify successful installation:**

- Look for the absence of errors in the console output.
- Run:

```bash
npm ls
```

It will display the dependency tree. Check for any missing or invalid packages.

<Note>
If you encounter errors such as permission issues or network errors, see the Troubleshooting section below.
</Note>

## 3. Managing and Verifying Required Packages

To maintain a stable development environment, ensure these key packages are installed correctly:

| Package Name       | Purpose                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| `vue`              | Core Vue.js framework            |
| `@vue/cli-service` | Vue CLI service utilities        |
| `firebase`         | Firebase SDK for backend integration |
| `eslint`           | Code linting tool                |

You can confirm these packages by inspecting `package.json` under dependencies and devDependencies.

### Verifying Specific Package Versions

Run:

```bash
npm list <package-name>
```

Example:

```bash
npm list vue
```

Expected output shows the installed version, e.g., `vue@2.6.12`.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems">
<Accordion title="Network or Timeout Errors during npm install">

- Check your internet connection.
- Clear npm cache:

  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  ```

- Try using a different npm registry temporarily:

  ```bash
  npm install --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
  ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied or EACCES Errors">

- Avoid running npm commands with sudo unless necessary.
- On macOS/Linux, fix permissions with:

  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
  ```

- Consider using a Node version manager (nvm) to avoid global permission problems.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing or Invalid Packages Detected">

- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall:

  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  ```


- Ensure your `package.json` is intact and dependencies are not manually altered incorrectly.

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- Always install dependencies after pulling new changes from the repository.
- Lock your node version using `.nvmrc` or document the exact Node.js version to prevent inconsistency.
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for security issues in packages.

## 6. Whatâ€™s Next?

Once dependencies are installed correctly:

1. Move on to the [Initializing Project & Environment](./getting-started/installation/first-project-setup) to configure your environment.
2. Follow with [Configuring Firebase](./getting-started/configuration-run/firebase-setup) to prepare backend connectivity.

<Check>
Confirm that `npm install` completes without errors and that required packages are present before continuing.
</Check>
