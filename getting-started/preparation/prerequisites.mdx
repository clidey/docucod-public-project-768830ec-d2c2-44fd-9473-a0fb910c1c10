# Prerequisites

This page ensures you have all essential tools, environments, and accounts set up before you start working with Aura. Verifying these prerequisites upfront guarantees compatibility, reduces setup errors, and smooths your onboarding experience.

---

## 1. Required System Tools and Versions

Aura is built using modern JavaScript technologies and frameworks. To develop or run Aura locally or prepare it for deployment, you must have specific tools installed with compatible versions.

### Node.js
- **Version:** 14.x or 16.x (LTS versions recommended)
- **Purpose:** Provides the runtime to run the Aura build tools, development servers, and package management.
- **Installation:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and follow platform-specific installation instructions.

  <Tip>
  Always install the LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js to ensure stability and compatibility with Vue CLI and other dependencies.
  </Tip>

### npm (Node Package Manager)
- **Version:** npm 6.x or later (bundled with Node.js)
- **Verification:** Run `npm -v` after installing Node.js to check.

### Vue CLI
- **Version:** Vue CLI 4.x or 5.x
- **Purpose:** Used to scaffold projects, run local development servers, and build the app.
- **Installation:** Run the following command globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @vue/cli
  ```

- **Verification:** Confirm installation with:

  ```bash
  vue --version
  ```

  This should output your installed version.

  <Tip>
  If you encounter permissions issues on macOS or Linux, consider using a node version manager like `nvm` to manage Node and npm installations.
  </Tip>

## 2. Firebase Account and Project Setup

Aura depends on Firebase as its backend platform. To integrate successfully, you need an active Firebase account and a configured project.

### Firebase Account
- Create a Firebase account via [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/).
- Ensure you have permissions to create and manage Firebase projects.

### Firebase Project
- Create a new Firebase project or use an existing one.
- The Firebase project **must be linked** with the Aura Admin project to ensure seamless data synchronization.
- Collect the Firebase configuration values (API key, Project ID, etc.) from your Firebase Console under **Project Settings > General > Your apps > Firebase SDK snippet** (Config tab).

  <Note>
  Using separate Firebase projects for Aura and Aura Admin will cause data integration failures.
  </Note>

### Enable Firestore Database
- From the Firebase Console, enable Cloud Firestore in **Native Mode**.
- Ensure appropriate read and write rules are configured based on your deployment (development or production).

### Firebase CLI (Optional, for deployment)
- Install Firebase CLI globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

- Login via command line when ready to deploy:

  ```bash
  firebase login
  ```

## 3. Network and Access Requirements

- Stable internet connection for downloading tools, packages, and syncing with Firebase backend.
- Firewall and proxy settings should allow:
  - HTTPS traffic to Firebase endpoints
  - Ports used by Vue CLI dev server (default 8080)

  <Warning>
  Restricted network environments can cause errors during installation or Firebase connectivity. Ensure necessary network permissions are granted.
  </Warning>

## 4. Verifying Your Setup

Before proceeding to install dependencies or run the app, verify your tools and accounts:

### Command-line Verification
Run the following commands and check their outputs:

```bash
node -v
# Should output v14.x or v16.x

npm -v
# Should output 6.x or later

vue --version
# Should output Vue CLI version 4.x or 5.x

firebase --version
# (If firebase CLI installed) Outputs latest Firebase CLI version
```

### Firebase Project Check
- From your Firebase Console, confirm:
  - Firestore is enabled
  - Configuration details are accessible
  - You have the correct project linked with Aura and Aura Admin

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Mismatched Node Versions:** Using unsupported Node versions (too new or too old) causes build failures.
- **Firebase Project Mismatch:** Double-check the Firebase Project ID used by Aura matches with Aura Admin.
- **Missing Firebase CLI:** Although optional, Firebase CLI simplifies deployment and should be installed before production rollout.
- **Network Timeouts:** Proxy or firewall blocks can hang package installations or API calls. Consider disabling proxies temporarily or whitelisting URLs.

## 6. Next Steps

Once prerequisites are verified and installed:

- Proceed to [Installing Dependencies](../installation/installing-dependencies) to set up your local project.
- Follow [Firebase Setup](../configuration-run/firebase-setup) for linking Firebase with Aura.
- Run Aura locally by following [Running Aura Locally](../configuration-run/local-run).
