# Building for Production

Learn how to create a production-ready build of Aura. This guide walks you through bundling your app, optimizing assets, and preparing your build to meet hosting requirements.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before building for production, ensure the following:

- **Local Development Environment Ready**: You have successfully installed dependencies and run Aura locally in development mode. Refer to [Running Aura Locally & Initial Validation](../installation-and-configuration/local-run-validation).
- **Firebase Configuration Completed**: Your Firebase project is configured to support your app. Confirm proper setup with [Firebase Integration & Configuration](../installation-and-configuration/firebase-configuration).
- **Aura Admin Setup**: Aura Main app expects the Aura Admin to be configured on the same Firebase project. See [Aura Admin Setup Prerequisite](../setup-prerequisites/aura-admin-notice).
- **Node.js and npm Available**: Node.js (version 12 or later) and npm are installed on your system.

<Tip>
Make sure your app runs flawlessly in development mode before proceeding. This ensures the production build will bundle correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Production Build Overview

Building for production creates an optimized, bundled version of Aura that is smaller, faster, and ready to be deployed to your hosting environment.

Key aspects of the build process:

- Minifies JavaScript and CSS files
- Removes development-only code
- Bundles all application modules into optimized chunks
- Generates assets in the `dist` directory

The build output meets Firebase Hosting requirements out of the box.

## 3. Step-by-Step Production Build Instructions

Follow these steps from your Aura project root directory:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Run this once if dependencies are not installed:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Vue, Vuetify, Firebase SDK, and all other necessary packages.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Production Build">
Execute the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Expected output:
- Compilation process with progress shown
- Assets created in a new `dist` folder

This command uses Vue CLI's built-in production mode which disables source maps for better performance.

If the build finishes without errors, your production files are ready.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Build Artifacts">
Examine the `dist` directory created:

```
dist/
├── css/
├── js/
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
└── manifest.json
```

- `index.html`: The main entry HTML
- `css/` and `js/`: Bundled CSS and JavaScript assets

Ensure these files exist and have recent timestamps.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Key Configuration Details

Aura's production build respects the following important configuration files:

- **vue.config.js**: Controls webpack build optimizations including disabling prefetch to improve load performance and service worker setup for PWA support.
- **firebase.json**: Defines Firebase Hosting settings such as the `dist` directory as the public folder and routing all requests to `index.html` to support SPA nature.

Example snippet from `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "myaurapp",
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [ {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
    } ],
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

Ensure your Firebase Hosting points to the `dist` folder that contains the production build assets.

## 5. Preparing for Hosting

To meet hosting environment needs, consider the following:

- **Service Worker Enabled**: Aura includes service worker registration for offline support and efficient caching.
- **No Source Maps**: Disabled in production for security and size reduction.
- **Proper Rewrite Rules**: SPA fallback routing enabled through Firebase configuration.

<Tip>
If you plan to deploy your app on Firebase Hosting, make sure you have initialized Firebase Hosting with `firebase init hosting` and linked your project. The build output fits seamlessly here.
</Tip>

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Build Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Fails with Errors">
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies or syntax errors in code.
- **Fix**: Run `npm install` to update modules. Check console output for specific error lines and correct code.

If unfamiliar with errors, review earlier setup and validation steps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Is Successful but Deploy Shows Blank Screen">
- **Cause**: Hosting rewrite rules missing or incorrectly configured.
- **Fix**: Ensure your `firebase.json` rewrite routes all URLs to `/index.html`.

- Double-check that the `dist` directory is used as your public directory.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assets Not Loading or Broken Links">
- **Cause**: Incorrect base URL or cached old files.
- **Fix**: Clear browser cache and confirm your deployment serves assets from the correct directory.

- Confirm the base href in `public/index.html` matches your hosting environment.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps and Deployment

Once your production build is ready and verified, you are prepared to deploy your Aura app.

Refer to the next guide [Deploying to Firebase Hosting](../deployment-quickstart/firebase-deployment) for detailed deployment instructions.

Additionally, consider these enhancements:

- **Setup Environment Variables** for production configuration tuning (covered in Deployment docs).
- **Configure Monitoring & Logging** to observe app health post-deployment.

---

## Summary

Building Aura for production bundles and optimizes your app for fast, secure hosting. This process generates deployable assets in the `dist` folder, prepared with proper Firebase hosting and service worker settings.

With your production build clear and ready, deploying to hosting becomes straightforward.

## Commands Summary

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build production assets
npm run build

# Verify dist folder contents
ls dist
```

<Tip>
Keep your package.json scripts unchanged to maintain compatibility with Vue CLI's production build system.
</Tip>

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

- If `npm run build` fails, check Node.js version and update dependencies.
- Confirm that your environment variables and Firebase project IDs match across config files.
- Clear local browser cache after deploying to avoid stale assets.

Congratulations! You have now built a production-ready version of Aura and laid the groundwork for seamless deployment.
