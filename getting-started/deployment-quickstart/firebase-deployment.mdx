# Deploying to Firebase Hosting

Deploying your Aura web application to Firebase Hosting unlocks global access, streamlined updates, and secure delivery with blazing-fast performance. This guide walks you through every critical step—from connecting your local codebase to Firebase Hosting, configuring essential deployment files, to deploying your app and verifying that it is live and accessible.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Setup Checks

Before deploying, ensure the following prerequisites are met for a smooth and secure deployment experience:

- **Firebase Account & Project:** You must have a Firebase project configured in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
- **Firebase CLI Installed:** Install the Firebase CLI globally using:

  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

- **Firebase CLI Login:** Authenticate with Firebase:

  ```bash
  firebase login
  ```

- **Project Code:** Your Aura app codebase is cloned and dependencies installed (`npm install`).
- **Production Build Ready:** Run the production build:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This generates the optimized `dist` folder ready for deployment.

- **Firebase Project ID:** Know your Firebase project ID from the Firebase Console project settings.

- **Correct `.firebaserc` Setup:** Your project’s `.firebaserc` file must reference your Firebase project ID.


<Tip>
Having the same Firebase project shared between Aura and Aura Admin ensures seamless data integration and avoids runtime issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Configure Firebase Hosting Files

Firebase Hosting uses two key config files: `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`. Configure these as follows to connect your app deployment with the Firebase project.

### 2.1 Update `firebase.json`

This file defines how Firebase serves and rewrites requests for your application.

1. Open `firebase.json` at your project root.
2. Ensure the `hosting.site` field matches your Firebase Hosting Site ID (usually your project ID).
3. Verify the `public` folder points to the `dist` folder generated by your build.
4. Confirm rewrites redirect all URLs to `index.html` for SPA routing.

Example snippet:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "myaurapp",
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [{
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }],
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Verify or Create `.firebaserc`

This file associates your project with Firebase CLI:

1. Make sure `.firebaserc` exists in your project root.
2. It should map the default project to your Firebase Project ID:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "myaurapp"
  }
}
```

Replace `myaurapp` with your actual Firebase project ID.

<Warning>
The `firebase.json` site's `site` key **must exactly match** the site ID/package name you receive from Firebase Hosting setup.
</Warning>

## 3. Deploying Your Application

Once your build output and configuration files are ready, use the Firebase CLI to deploy your app.

### Step-by-Step Deployment

<Steps>
<Step title="Build Your Production Bundle">
Run the build command to generate the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure the `dist` folder contains an `index.html` and static assets.
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize Firebase in Your Project">
If this is your first deployment, initialize Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

- Select your existing Firebase project.
- Set your public directory to `dist`.
- Choose to configure as a Single Page Application (SPA) to set rewriting.
- Decline automatic build triggers if asked.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy to Firebase Hosting">
Run the deploy command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Firebase will upload your `dist` content and publish it.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Deployment">
After deployment completes, Firebase CLI will display your live site URLs:

```
Hosting URL: https://myaurapp.web.app
Hosting URL: https://myaurapp.firebaseapp.com
```

Open the URL in your browser to confirm your Aura app is live.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use `firebase deploy --only hosting` if you want to deploy only the hosting without affecting other Firebase services.
</Tip>

## 4. Confirming Your Live Site

### How to Identify Your Live URL

- The primary hosting URL is typically:
  - `https://<your-project-id>.web.app`
  - or `https://<your-project-id>.firebaseapp.com`
- Confirm this URL in the Firebase Console under Hosting.

### Sharing Your Application

- Use the above URL to share your Aura web app with your community.
- Consider custom domains in Firebase Hosting settings if you want branded URLs.

<Info>
Firebase Hosting automatically provides HTTPS and a global CDN, ensuring secure and fast access worldwide.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Deployment Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Deployment Fails at Upload">
- Check your network connection.
- Ensure you are logged in (`firebase login`).
- Verify Firebase CLI version is up to date (`npm i -g firebase-tools`).
- Confirm correct `.firebaserc` project ID.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Site Loads Old Content After Deployment">
- Clear your browser cache or try using an incognito window.
- Confirm your `firebase.json` rewrites are correctly routing all requests to `index.html`.
- Check service worker caching behavior in your app (PWA config).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unauthorized or Permission Errors">
- Verify your Firebase user account has Hosting permission in the Firebase Console.
- Check if you’re logged into the correct Firebase project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Folder Not Found or Empty">
- Double-check that you ran `npm run build`.
- Verify that the `dist` folder contains your built files before deploying.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Summary
Deploying to Firebase Hosting involves configuring your Firebase project reference, updating the `firebase.json` file to point to your production build output, and securely deploying your app using Firebase CLI. By following these steps, your Aura application will be globally accessible, backed by Firebase's CDN and HTTPS.
