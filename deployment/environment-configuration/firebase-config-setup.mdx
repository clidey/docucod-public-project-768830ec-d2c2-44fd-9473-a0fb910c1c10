# Firebase Project Configuration

Integrating Aura with Firebase requires precise configuration of your Firebase project credentials within your source code. This ensures smooth communication with Firebase services like Firestore, Authentication, Storage, and Messaging. This guide walks you through obtaining your Firebase project credentials from the Firebase Console, updating your `src/config/firebase.js` file, and understanding how to configure critical values such as Project ID, database URL, and Hosting Site ID for a reliable and secure integration.

---

## 1. Obtaining Firebase Project Credentials

To connect Aura to your Firebase backend, you first need to retrieve your Firebase project credentials. These credentials uniquely identify your project and allow your app to access Firebase services.

### Steps to Obtain Credentials:

1. **Open the Firebase Console**: Navigate to [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. **Select Your Firebase Project**: Make sure this is the same project used by your Aura Admin repository to maintain synchronization.
3. **Navigate to Project Settings**: Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to 'Project Overview' and select **Project settings**.
4. **Scroll to Your Apps Section**:
   - Under the **General** tab, locate the **Your apps** section.
   - If you haven't added a web app yet, click **Add app** and select the web platform (`</>`). Follow the prompts.
5. **Reveal Firebase SDK Configuration**: Choose the **Config** option under **Firebase SDK snippet**.
6. **Copy the Firebase Config Object**: It resembles the following:

```js
apiKey: "AIzaSyCOl0qzkhCDmyWeeIT8AZe4xyJJlIfU5gE",
authDomain: "myaurapp.firebaseapp.com",
databaseURL: "https://myaurapp.firebaseio.com",
projectId: "myaurapp",
storageBucket: "myaurapp.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId: "419511997060",
appId: "1:419511997060:web:ce7aa0d308f6b484f868d1"
```

### Key Elements Explained:

- **apiKey**: Your web app's API key for authorizing requests.
- **authDomain**: Domain used for Firebase Authentication.
- **databaseURL**: URL of your Firebase Realtime Database.
- **projectId**: Unique identifier for your Firebase project.
- **storageBucket**: Cloud Storage bucket for your files.
- **messagingSenderId**: Identifier for Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- **appId**: Unique application ID.

<Tip>
Always use the same Firebase project for both Aura Main and Aura Admin to ensure consistent data synchronization and seamless community management.
</Tip>

## 2. Updating Your Source Code with Firebase Credentials

Once you have your Firebase project credentials, update the configuration file in your Aura Main app to establish the connection.

### File to Update:
`src/config/firebase.js`

### How to Update:

1. Open `src/config/firebase.js` in your code editor.
2. Replace the placeholder or existing values inside the `firebaseConfig` object with your copied Firebase config values.

Example snippet:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCOl0qzkhCDmyWeeIT8AZe4xyJJlIfU5gE",
  authDomain: "myaurapp.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://myaurapp.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "myaurapp",
  storageBucket: "myaurapp.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "419511997060",
  appId: "1:419511997060:web:ce7aa0d308f6b484f868d1"
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

3. Save changes to the file.

<Tip>
Ensure no extraneous spaces or missing commas occur in the config object to prevent initialization errors.
</Tip>

## 3. Configuring Project ID, Database URL, and Hosting Site ID

Properly setting your Firebase identifiers beyond just the config file is essential for deployment and runtime stability.

### A. Project ID

- Serves as the unique identifier for your Firebase project.
- Must match across your project files, Firebase Console, and CLI configuration.

### B. Database URL

- Used by Firebase SDK to connect to your Realtime Database instance.
- Typically in the format: `https://<project-id>.firebaseio.com`

### C. Firebase Hosting Site ID

- The Site ID is distinct and identifies your hosting instance.
- To locate your Site ID:
  1. In Firebase Console, select **Hosting** from the left sidebar.
  2. Click **Get Started** if not already enabled.
  3. The autogenerated subdomain URL will look like `<site-id>.web.app` or `<site-id>.firebaseapp.com`.
  4. Use the string before `.web.app` or `.firebaseapp.com` as the Site ID.

### Updating Your Hosting Site ID

Ensure your hosting configuration uses this Site ID.

- In your project root, open `firebase.json`.
- Update the `site` key under the `hosting` block:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "myaurapp",   
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `myaurapp` with your actual Hosting Site ID.

<Tip>
Misconfiguring the Hosting Site ID will lead to deployment errors or your site being unreachable after deployment. Double-check this value.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Validating Your Configuration

After updating the config files, validate that your app correctly connects to Firebase:

- Run the app locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

- If your Firebase credentials are correct, Aura will load data and not show connection errors.
- If you see messages like "Either Your Internet is not Working or Site is not Configured," it usually points to configuration issues.

<Tip>
Use the Firebase Console’s Firestore Database and Authentication tabs to verify that data and users exist and are being updated during local testing.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Keys**: Consider using environment variables for API keys in advanced deployments.
- **Synchronize Configurations**: Keep `firebase.js`, `firebase.json`, and `.firebaserc` files in sync concerning Project ID and Site ID.
- **Match Firebase Projects for Aura Admin and Aura Main**: To maintain data consistency.
- **Secure Your Firebase Credentials**: Avoid exposing credentials in public repositories.

### Common Pitfalls

- Using mismatched Project IDs between Firebase Console and config files.
- Copying incorrect Hosting Site ID or leaving the default.
- Typo or missing comma in `firebase.js` configuration causing app initialization failure.
- Forgetting to enable necessary Firebase services (Firestore, Authentication, Storage) in the console.

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to build your Aura app for production using the configuration: [Production Build & Deploy](../deployment-workflow/production-build-deploy).
- Prepare and deploy to Firebase Hosting following the step-by-step deployment: [Deploying to Firebase Hosting](../../getting-started/run-validate-deploy/firebase-deployment).
- For security best practices around Firebase, consult: [Firebase Security Setup](../../deployment/backup-security/firebase-security-setup).
