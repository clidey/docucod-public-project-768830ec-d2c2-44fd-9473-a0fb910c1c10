# Security Hardening

Ensuring the security of your Aura deployment is paramount to protect your community data, user interactions, and maintain trust. This guide provides core recommendations tailored to secure your Firebase integration, enforce strict permissions, and harden your hosting environment against common vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Secure Your Firebase Keys

Aura uses Firebase extensively, with configuration keys embedded in `src/config/firebase.js`. While Firebase API keys are not secret by nature, following these best practices reduces risk:

- **Restrict API Key Usage:** Go to your Firebase Console and restrict your API keys to authorized domains and services. This prevents misuse outside your deployed app.
- **Do Not Embed Sensitive Secrets:** Never store admin SDK keys or service account credentials in the frontend source code.
- **Regularly Rotate Keys:** Periodically regenerate keys in your Firebase project settings to reduce exposure.

### Example Firebase Configuration Location

```js
// src/config/firebase.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCOl0qzkhCDmyWeeIT8AZe4xyJJlIfU5gE",
  authDomain: "myaurapp.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://myaurapp.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "myaurapp",
  storageBucket: "myaurapp.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "419511997060",
  appId: "1:419511997060:web:ce7aa0d308f6b484f868d1"
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

<Tip>
Always update these keys when moving between development and production environments. Use environment variables and build-time configurations to handle different stages securely.
</Tip>

## 2. Restrict Firebase Permissions

Fine-grained permission settings are critical to limit what your users and clients can do:

- **Firestore and Storage Rules:** Define strict Firestore security rules and Storage permission rules to only allow authenticated and authorized users the necessary access.
- **Minimal Privilege Principle:** Grant only the permissions your application absolutely requires, no open read/write to all data.
- **Enable Firestore Offline Persistence Carefully:** While Aura enables Firestore offline support, validate permission configurations to prevent offline clients from accessing restricted data.

<Note>
Refer to [Firebase Security Rules documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules) to craft and test your rules meticulously.
</Note>

## 3. Enforce HTTPS Everywhere

Secure transport is foundational:

- **Firebase Hosting Uses HTTPS By Default:** Aura deployed on Firebase Hosting automatically benefits from HTTPS which encrypts data in transit.
- **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** Confirm that your Firebase Hosting config (via `firebase.json`) enforces redirect rules so all access happens over secure channels.

### Example `firebase.json` snippet

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "myaurapp",
    "public": "dist",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

<Tip>
Use Firebase Hosting's HTTPS and HSTS headers to enforce strict transport security policies automatically.
</Tip>

## 4. Keep Dependencies Up to Date

Regular updates mitigate vulnerabilities introduced via libraries or frameworks:

- **Update Vue, Vuetify, and Firebase SDK:** Use npm or yarn to keep dependencies at current stable versions.
- **Monitor Vulnerability Advisories:** Subscribe to alerts for your technology stack.
- **Rebuild and Redeploy:** Always rebuild your app (`npm run build`) with updated dependencies and redeploy to Firebase.

<Warning>
Neglecting updates can expose your deployment to known exploits or degrade PWA and offline security features.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Protect Your Deployment Surface

Beyond code, secure the deployment infrastructure itself:

- **Limit Firebase Console Access:** Use Firebase IAM roles to grant deployment and project access only to trusted team members.
- **Environment Configuration:** Do not hardcode sensitive environment variables; use `.env` files or Firebase environment configs handled securely.
- **Disable Debugging in Production:** Ensure Vue production config disables devtools and console logs where possible.

<Tip>
Monitor your Firebase project's activity logs regularly for unauthorized access or unusual activity.
</Tip>

## 6. Additional Security Best Practices

- **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Mitigate cross-site scripting by defining CSP headers in your hosting setup.
- **Validate All Input Client-Side and Server-Side:** Prevent injection and malformed data entries.
- **Secure Service Worker:** Confirm your `service-worker.js` is configured securely to avoid risks related to PWA offline caching.

## Troubleshooting Common Security Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Security Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Firebase Permission Denied Errors">
Check Firestore and Storage security rules to ensure authenticated users have correct read/write permissions. Review Firebase logs for denied requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mixed Content or HTTP Access">
Verify your hosting URL is HTTPS and no external scripts or assets are loaded over HTTP. Update all resource links to HTTPS.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Outdated SDKs Causing Vulnerabilities">
Audit your npm dependencies with `npm audit`. Upgrade vulnerable packages and confirm compatibility before deploying.
</Accordion>

## Summary
Securing your Aura deployment involves protecting Firebase keys, enforcing strict permission rules, ensuring encrypted transport, keeping software updated, and guarding the deployment environments. Adopting these practices will build a robust and resilient community platform.
