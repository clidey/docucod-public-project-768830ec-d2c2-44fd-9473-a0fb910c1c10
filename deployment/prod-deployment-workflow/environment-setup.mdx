# Environment Setup & Configuration

This guide walks you through the essential prerequisites and initial configuration steps required to set up Aura's development and deployment environment. By following these instructions, you will replicate a consistent local development environment and prepare your project for smooth deployment.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before configuring your Aura environment, ensure you have the following components installed and set up on your system:

- **Node.js**: Aura requires Node.js version between 8.9.4 and 12.13.0.
  - Download and install from the [official Node.js page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **Vue CLI**: This is necessary for managing the Vue.js project.
  - Install globally using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @vue/cli
    ```

- **Firebase Project**: Aura and Aura Admin must share the same Firebase project for seamless data integration.
  - Create a Firebase Project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
  - Set up a new Web App under the project settings.

- **Firebase CLI (optional for deployment)**: Required when deploying to Firebase Hosting.
  - Install globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

## 2. Cloning and Installing Project Dependencies

Follow these steps to get the Aura project ready locally:

### Step 1: Clone Aura Repository

Clone the Aura repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gdg-x/aura.git
cd aura
```

> **Important:** You must also clone and set up the [Aura Admin](https://github.com/gdg-x/aura-admin) repository separately and use the same Firebase project for both.


### Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

Inside the cloned Aura directory, install dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

This ensures all required libraries and tools are available.

---

## 3. Firebase Configuration

Aura relies on Firebase for backend services like authentication, database, storage, and messaging. The app uses a config file to link to your Firebase project.

### Step 1: Retrieve Firebase SDK Configuration

- Open your Firebase Console.
- Navigate to `Project Settings` > `General`.
- Locate your web app under "Your apps".
- Click 'Config' under Firebase SDK snippet.
- Copy the configuration snippet, which looks like:

```js
apiKey: "Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
authDomain: "xxxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
databaseURL: "https://xxxxxxxx.firebaseio.com",
projectId: "xxxxxxxxx",
storageBucket: "xxxxxxx.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxx",
appId: "1:xxxxxxxxx:web:xxxxxxx"
```

### Step 2: Update the Firebase Config File

Replace the placeholder config with your project details in the file located at:

`src/config/firebase.js`

Example update:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "Your_API_Key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-project.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "Your_App_ID"
};
```

> This linkage is critical for enabling your app to communicate with Firebase services.

---

## 4. Vue CLI and Project Configuration

### Step 1: Configure `vue.config.js`

Ensure your Firebase project ID or relevant environment variables are correctly represented inside `vue.config.js` if custom fields or environment references are needed for building or deployment.

### Step 2: Store Vuex State Initialization

Aura's store (`src/store/index.js`) initializes application navigation and config objects. Your Firebase configuration will sync here during runtime to control app-wide settings.

---

## 5. Running Aura Locally

With your environment set, verify the setup by running Aura in development mode:

```bash
npm run serve
```

- The app will compile and start a hot-reloading dev server.
- Open your browser to the indicated localhost URL (usually http://localhost:8080).
- On first run, you may see a message:

  > "Either Your Internet is not Working or Site is not Configured"

  This means initial data from Firebase has not yet loaded; check your Firebase config and network connectivity.

---

## 6. Verifying Local Environment Consistency

Aura's state relies on properly loaded configuration data:
- During app startup, the Vuex store tries fetching config; if it fails, the no-data indicator shows.
- Ensure your Firebase rules allow read access (safely) during development for this step.

<Check>
If you face persistent loading or empty states:
- Confirm your Firebase credentials in `firebase.js`.
- Check network availability.
- Inspect console for errors related to Firestore permissions or configuration.
</Check>

---

## 7. Preparing for Production Builds

Once local testing succeeds, prepare the app for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

- This command creates an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
- Assets are minified and bundled for performance.
- Next, you'll link this build with Firebase Hosting or your chosen hosting service.

---

## 8. Summary: Environment Replication

1. Install Node.js and Vue CLI.
2. Clone Aura (and Aura Admin) repositories.
3. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Create Firebase project and set up a web app.
5. Update `src/config/firebase.js` with your Firebase config.
6. Run `npm run serve` locally to verify.
7. Build with `npm run build` for production.

---

## 9. Best Practices & Tips

- Use the same Firebase project for Aura Main and Aura Admin to avoid data inconsistency.
- Regularly update dependencies and test locally before any deployment.
- Backup your `firebase.js` config securely and avoid exposing sensitive keys publicly.
- Leverage Firebase Firestore's offline persistence enabled in Aura for smooth offline experiences.

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Setup Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="App Shows 'Site Not Configured' or No Data">
Check that:
- Your Firebase project details in `firebase.js` are accurate.
- Your internet connection is active.
- Firebase Firestore rules permit read access.
- Your Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage) are correctly enabled in the console.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="npm install Fails or Dependencies Missing">
- Ensure your Node.js version matches the required range (8.x to 12.x).
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`.
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and reinstall.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Local Server Won't Start or Port Conflicts">
- Check if another process is using port 8080 or default Vue CLI port.
- Change the port by editing `vue.config.js` or starting with:
  ```bash
  npm run serve -- --port 8081
  ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
