# Backup and Disaster Recovery

Protecting your community data is paramount to maintaining trust and uninterrupted service. This guide provides clear recommendations on leveraging Firebase's backup features to safeguard your Aura application's data. Learn how to schedule backups, verify their integrity, and efficiently restore your app after accidental loss or outages.

---

## 1. Understanding Firebase Backup Capabilities

Aura relies heavily on Firebase Firestore for storing essential community data such as events, team members, speakers, and configurations. Firebase itself offers several mechanisms to secure this data:

- **Firestore Export and Import:** Manual or programmatic export of collections to Google Cloud Storage.
- **Automated Scheduled Backups:** Using Firebase Extensions or Cloud Functions.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Limited via export snapshots.

While Aura does not include built-in backup automation, you can integrate these Firebase features to create a robust data protection strategy.

<Note>
Backups focus on Firestore data. Files stored in Firebase Storage and configuration data require separate strategies.
</Note>

## 2. Scheduling Backups for Firestore Data

To avoid data loss, implement regular backups of your Firestore database. The recommended approach is to use Google Cloud Scheduler along with Cloud Functions to automate exports.

### Practical Steps:

1. **Set Up a Google Cloud Storage Bucket**
   - Create a bucket dedicated for Firestore exports.
2. **Create a Cloud Function to Export Firestore Data**
   - This function triggers exports of your entire Firestore database or specified collections to the bucket.
3. **Configure Cloud Scheduler**
   - Schedule the Cloud Function to run at periodic intervals (e.g., daily at midnight) to capture up-to-date snapshot exports.

For detailed setup, refer to [Firebase official documentation on Firestore export and import](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/export-import).

<Tip>
Automate your backups to run off hours when app usage is low to reduce potential performance impacts.
</Tip>

## 3. Validating Backup Integrity

A backup is only as good as its recoverability. Regularly verify:

- **Successful Completion:** Check Cloud Scheduler logs and Cloud Function execution results.
- **Backup File Availability:** Confirm exported backup files exist in Cloud Storage.
- **Backup Content:** Periodically perform test restores in a staging environment to verify backup completeness.

<Warning>
Do not assume backups are valid without verification. Schedule validation routines as part of your operations.
</Warning>

## 4. Restoring Data After Loss or Outage

Accidents happenâ€”whether data corruption, unintended deletions, or outages. Firebase allows you to restore your Firestore database from backup snapshots.

### Restoration Workflow:

1. **Access Backup Files**
   - Locate the most recent valid export in your Cloud Storage bucket.
2. **Use Firestore Import Feature**
   - Import the backup data back into your Firestore instance via the Firebase CLI or Cloud Console.
3. **Validate Restoration**
   - Confirm that all expected collections and documents are restored correctly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate Backup Files">
Review your Cloud Storage bucket for the appropriate backup timestamp folder.
</Step>
<Step title="Import Data">
Run the CLI command:
```bash
firebase firestore:import gs://<your-bucket-name>/<backup-folder>
```
to restore the database.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Restoration">
Test your app functionality and check the Firestore console to verify data integrity.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Perform restores during planned maintenance windows to minimize user impact.

## 5. Best Practices for Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **Automate Backups:** Manual backups risk human error and delays.
- **Retain Multiple Backup Versions:** Keep at least a week's worth to mitigate latent data corruption.
- **Secure Backup Storage:** Apply strict IAM roles on your Cloud Storage bucket.
- **Document Recovery Procedures:** Ensure your team can act quickly when needed.
- **Test Restorations Regularly:** Validate your DR plan under simulated failure scenarios.

## 6. Handling Firebase Storage and Other Data

Aura also leverages Firebase Storage for media assets. While Firestore backups do not cover Storage data:

- Enable [Firebase Storage backup](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-object-versioning) via object versioning.
- Regularly copy critical files to another reliable storage service.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Backup Failures:** Check Cloud Function permissions and quota limits.
- **Data Inconsistency After Restore:** Ensure atomic import operations and avoid partial restores.
- **Storage Bucket Access Denied:** Review Cloud Storage IAM roles.

<Tip>
Monitor all backup and restore operations remotely via Firebase Console or custom dashboards.
</Tip>

## Appendix: Aura Specific Backup Considerations

- **Offline Persistence:** Aura enables Firestore offline persistence for client devices, but this is not a backup substitute.
- **Service Worker Cache:** Cached app shell and assets do not include Firestore data and hence are not a recovery option.

<Note>
Refer to the [Optimizing PWA and Offline Support](../guides/advanced-customization-and-optimization/optimizing-pwa-and-offline-support) guide for details on app caching which complements but does not replace data backup.
</Note>

For a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy, combine Firebase native backup tools with operational vigilance and documented recovery procedures.
