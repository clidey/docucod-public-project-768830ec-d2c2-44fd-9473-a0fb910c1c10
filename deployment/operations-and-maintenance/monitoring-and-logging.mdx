# Monitoring and Logging in Aura

Tracking the health and activity of your deployed Aura instance is crucial for maintaining a responsive, performant, and bug-free community web experience. This guide walks you through the practical options to monitor Aura’s usage, errors, and performance, primarily leveraging Firebase's native tools along with integrations for deeper insights.

## Why Monitoring Matters

Imagine your Aura site running smoothly, showcasing events and teams with real-time updates. Suddenly, a misconfiguration leads to data loading failures or users experience slow interactions. Without monitoring, these issues go unnoticed, affecting your community's engagement and reputation.

Monitoring in Aura ensures:
- Real-time visibility into app performance and errors
- Proactive identification and resolution of issues
- Data-driven understanding of user behavior

This empowers you to keep your community site fast, reliable, and delightful.

## Monitoring Options Available

Aura’s Firebase backend and modern frontend architecture offer several monitoring methods:

### 1. Firebase Console Monitoring
The Firebase console provides built-in insights into the core Firebase services Aura uses.

- **Firestore Usage Metrics**: Track read, write, and delete operations to understand data load patterns.
- **Authentication Logs**: Monitor sign-ins and authentication events.
- **Storage Insights**: Observe usage statistics related to media and file storage.
- **Crashlytics (optional to integrate)**: While not part of default Aura setup, enabling Crashlytics can provide crash reports for mobile or web apps.

### 2. Cloud Functions and Firestore Logging
While Aura does not ship with backend cloud functions by default, if you extend Aura with custom Firebase Cloud Functions:

- Enable **Cloud Function Logs** via the Firebase console to track execution patterns and errors.
- Use **Firestore security rules logging** for permission-related diagnostics.

### 3. Frontend Logging and Service Worker Logs
Aura registers a service worker for PWA offline support.

- **Service Worker Logs**: In production, registered service worker logs help track caching, update checks, and offline usage.
- **Console Logs**: Disabled rules in `.eslintrc.js` (e.g., `no-console: off`) means developers can write console logs for debugging.

### 4. Third-Party Monitoring Tools Integration
For advanced user analytics and error tracking, you may consider integrating third-party services like Sentry for error reporting or Google Analytics for usage metrics.

- Integrate by inserting scripts or initializing SDKs in your Aura codebase.
- Remember to keep privacy policies aligned.

## How to Monitor Aura Effectively

### Access Firebase Console
1. Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Select your Aura Firebase project.
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** > **Usage** to monitor read/write metrics and database performance.
4. Check **Authentication** > **Users** to view user login activity.
5. Review **Storage** > **Usage** for storage consumption.
6. If using Cloud Functions, open **Functions** > **Logs** for backend monitoring.

### Inspect Service Worker Logs
Open your browser's developer tools when visiting the deployed Aura app:
- Go to the **Console** tab to view logs such as service worker registration, content caching, and update availability.
- Use the **Application** tab to see service worker status and cache details.

### Enable Additional Debugging During Development
While developing locally, you can:
- Use Vue DevTools to inspect component states and Vuex store.
- Observe real-time Firebase API interactions.

## Best Practices for Monitoring

- **Regularly Review Firebase Usage Dashboards:** Spot unusual spikes or drops in database or authentication usage early.
- **Listen for Service Worker Update Events:** Aura app listens for new content availability and prompts user refresh.
- **Set Up Alerts in Firebase:** Configure billing and quota alerts to avoid service disruption.
- **Log Key User Flows:** Add custom client-side logs if you extend Aura to capture critical user actions.

## Troubleshooting Common Monitoring Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Monitoring Challenges and Solutions">
<Accordion title="No Logs Visible in Firebase Console">
- Ensure you are looking at the correct Firebase project linked to your Aura deployment.
- Confirm your Firebase project is actively receiving traffic.
- If using Cloud Functions, check function deployment and permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Service Worker Logs Not Appearing">
- Make sure the app is running in production mode; service workers register only in production environment.
- Clear browser cache to reset registered service workers.
- Verify service worker registration in `src/registerServiceWorker.js`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow Firestore Reads or High Latency">
- Check Firestore usage quotas to confirm you haven't hit limits.
- Optimize data query patterns in your customizations.
- Use Firestore indexing as needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="User Analytics Missing or Incomplete">
- Confirm third-party analytics scripts are correctly embedded.
- Verify tracking IDs and configurations.
- Ad blockers and privacy settings can affect data collection.
</Accordion>
