# Scaling & Performance Optimization

Optimize Aura to deliver fast, reliable experiences that scale gracefully with growing community demand. This guide focuses on practical performance best practices including Lighthouse PWA optimization, offline support leveraging service workers, and tuning Firebase Hosting settings to maximize throughput during high traffic.

---

## 1. Understanding Aura's Performance Foundation

Aura is built as a progressive web app (PWA) optimized for SEO and offline access. Its Vue.js frontend, combined with Firebase Hosting and CDN, provides inherent scalability and performance gains. Familiarity with these core choices helps guide optimization efforts:

- **Static assets served through Firebase CDN** with intelligent caching for fast global delivery.
- **Service worker powered offline support** ensures app availability during network interruptions.
- **Production build includes code minification, tree shaking, and prefetch disabling** to streamline load times.

Knowing these foundations, the sections below detail actionable steps to tune and extend performance.

## 2. Lighthouse & PWA Best Practices

Run [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audits regularly to measure Aura’s web performance, accessibility, best practices, and PWA compliance. Key focus areas include:

### 2.1 Optimize Metrics
- **Performance Score**: Target 90+ by minimizing render-blocking resources and optimizing images.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Ensure critical content loads quickly by leveraging lazy loading for non-visible elements.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Keep JS bundles small and defer non-essential scripts.

### 2.2 PWA Compliance
- **Ensure service worker registration** (via `vue.config.js` using Workbox InjectManifest) to enable caching and offline support.
- **Maintain a valid web app manifest** with correct theme colors, icons, and metadata.
- **Test offline functionality** frequently to assure smooth user experience.

<Tip>
Run Lighthouse audits from multiple locations and device types to simulate real-world performance scenarios.
</Tip>

## 3. Leveraging Offline Support

Aura’s offline support is powered by a custom service worker defined in the `src/sw.js` file and configured via `vue.config.js`. Effective offline tuning involves:

- **Caching Strategy**: Cache key static assets (JS, CSS, images) and API responses where feasible.
- **Cache Updates**: Use the app’s UI refresh prompts (snackbar) to notify users when a new version is available.
- **Network Fallbacks**: Gracefully handle offline states with user-friendly messages or cached content.

### 3.1 Service Worker Configuration Notes

- The service worker is injected as `service-worker.js` during the production build.
- Utilizing Workbox allows fine-tuning caching rules and background sync.

### 3.2 Practical Tips

- Avoid caching overly large datasets which can bloat storage quota.
- Regularly update the service worker to ensure fresh content delivery.

<Note>
Aura’s service worker and PWA behavior are integrated out-of-the-box; custom modifications require careful testing to avoid unexpected cache issues.
</Note>

## 4. Firebase Hosting & CDN Optimization

Firebase Hosting provides Aura’s global edge CDN, caching, and SSL termination. To maximize performance at scale:

### 4.1 Hosting Configuration

- **firebase.json** file controls caching and rewrites. Use long cache durations for immutable static assets.
- Ensure `firebase.json` rewrite rules correctly support SPA routing for instant navigation.

### 4.2 CDN & Cache Control

- Configure **Cache-Control headers** for `/static`, `/js`, and `/css` assets to enable aggressive caching.
- Use short TTL for `index.html` and API endpoints to reflect updates promptly.

### 4.3 Handling Traffic Spikes

- Firebase Hosting scales automatically behind the scenes; no manual intervention required.
- Monitor usage metrics via the Firebase Console to stay informed about traffic patterns.

<Tip>
For high-traffic events, pre-warm your deployment by deploying earlier and validating all caches to prevent cold start latency spikes.
</Tip>

## 5. Production Build Optimization

The production build process fine-tunes Aura’s assets for speed and efficiency.

### 5.1 Build Execution

- Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to generate minified, compressed assets in the `dist` folder.
- The build disables `prefetch` and generates a service worker for offline use.

### 5.2 Bundle Analysis

- Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies or duplicated code.
- Remove or replace heavy libraries if possible.

### 5.3 Code Splitting

- Vue’s dynamic imports split the codebase, loading features only when needed, reducing initial payload.

<Check>
Always verify post-build that the app loads quickly on a variety of devices and networks.
</Check>

## 6. Monitoring & Capacity Planning

Understanding how Aura performs under load empowers informed scaling decisions.

### 6.1 Firebase Metrics

- Use Firebase Console to monitor Hosting bandwidth, request counts, and latency.
- Observe Firestore metrics for backend data request loads.

### 6.2 Performance Tuning

- Tune Vue app performance by managing reactive data updates and component rendering.
- Audit and reduce any client-side bottlenecks affecting interactivity.

### 6.3 Capacity Planning

- Plan for peak usage around major events and scale Firestore indexing and rules accordingly.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Service Worker Caching Issues:** If updated content does not appear, clear browser caches or unregister the service worker manually.
- **Slow Initial Loads:** Verify no large unused assets are being loaded upfront.
- **Misconfigured Firebase Hosting:** Incorrect rewrites can cause broken SPA routing.

Consult the [Troubleshooting Deployment](../deployment/troubleshooting-deployment) and [Monitoring & Logging](../runtime-operations/monitoring-logging) guides for detailed issue resolution.

## 8. Summary Checklist

- ✅ Validate Lighthouse metrics regularly, targeting 90+.
- ✅ Confirm offline support via the registered service worker.
- ✅ Configure Firebase Hosting caching policies smartly.
- ✅ Build Aura in production mode with service worker injected.
- ✅ Monitor Firebase Hosting and Firestore metrics continuously.
- ✅ Test under real-world conditions including offline scenarios.
