# Who Should Use Aura & Key Use Cases

## Empowering Community Organizers, Event Managers, and Teams

Aura is built for technology communities aiming to streamline their event and member management while promoting visibility and collaboration within and beyond their groups. Whether you're a community organizer planning impactful events, an event manager juggling schedules and speakers, or a team coordinator showcasing your core members, Aura is crafted with your real-world needs in mind.

### Primary Audiences

- **Community Organizers:** Manage your tech community’s presence with ease. Publish events, share team and speaker information, and engage your members through a modern, optimized Progressive Web App.

- **Event Managers:** Simplify the entire event lifecycle — from scheduling sessions to highlighting speakers and promoting events — Aura helps you maintain a dynamic event calendar that stays updated and accessible.

- **Team Coordinators and Core Team Members:** Showcase your community leaders and speakers with dedicated public profiles that support self-branding and community recognition.


## Real Productivity Scenarios with Aura

Aura supports key workflows that transform community and event management from a set of scattered tasks into a unified experience.

### 1. Publishing and Managing Events

Easily create, update, and publish events without needing to build a dedicated website for each new meetup or conference. Aura allows communities to:

- List upcoming and past events with detailed descriptions and media.
- Feature select events prominently to boost visibility.
- Provide attendees with quick access to event information on any device, even offline.

**Example:** A GDG organizer can swiftly publish their monthly meetup details, speakers, agenda, and venue information in Aura — enabling members to discover and RSVP effortlessly.

### 2. Showcasing Team Members & Speakers

Build and present public-facing profiles for your community's core team and speakers. Aura promotes transparency and personal branding by allowing:

- Profiles with biographies, designations, and social links.
- Easy navigation for community members and newcomers to discover team roles and contacts.
- Sharing speaker profiles for event promotion and networking.

**Example:** When preparing a conference, event coordinators can highlight keynote speakers and organizers directly in the app, driving attendee interest and networking opportunities.

### 3. Sharing Speaker Profiles and Self-Branding

Speakers can benefit from Aura’s public shareable URLs, helping them:

- Promote their sessions and personal brand beyond events.
- Link to their profiles from social media or professional sites.
- Foster community trust and engagement through enhanced visibility.

**Example:** A developer sharing their talk about Flutter can use Aura’s speaker profile URL for wider promotion, increasing participation and recognition.

### 4. Seamless Content Discovery & Mobile Accessibility

Aura’s mobile-first design ensures that community members have fast, offline-capable access to all essential event and team content anytime, anywhere.

- No dependence on constant internet connectivity.
- Optimized load times and easy navigation.
- Cross-device and platform accessibility supporting wider reach.
